/**
 * \remarks Geometry implementation is a disaster zone of platform problems.
 * Here are some notes. For geometry object:
 * 1. Some platforms just lack the concept of geometry. Even if there is one, it
 * usually has limited capabilities.
 * 2. Doing hit test right on the geometry out of context is not supported on
 * some platform. The geometry needs to be put on the context first.
 * 3. Create a geometry of a stroke of another geometry is not suppored more
 * widely.
 *
 * Workarounds:
 * 1. If the platform didn't support path at all, although not a platform does
 * so far, record the commands and replay it on context when it is used.
 * 2. If the geometry can't do hit test itself, always attach a canvas with it,
 * and when do hit test, put it on context first.
 * 3. There is no good workaround for 4, so don't use it, maybe.
 *
 * For geometry builder:
 * It is hard to conclude the common commands of all platforms. Some have this,
 * others not. Some don't have this, but others do. There are some common
 * commands that should be used frequently. If some platforms do not support it,
 * do it yourself to implement it with existing commands and fancy algorithm.
